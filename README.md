# Basic-C-sharp-Projects
These are some of the projects I worked on while taking the C3 .Net course from the Tech Academy. These are just some of the final small projects we worked on to explore building console and web applications as well as creating and connecting to databases for storing information. 
 
## Projects
 - [Car Insurance MVC](https://github.com/Haskasimo/Basic-C-sharp-Projects/tree/main/CarInsuranceMVC)
 - [CodeFirst Project](https://github.com/Haskasimo/Basic-C-sharp-Projects/tree/main/CodeFirstProject)
 - [TwentyOne 2](https://github.com/Haskasimo/Basic-C-sharp-Projects/tree/main/TwentyOne2)


### Car Insurance MVC

 This project is a beging infrastucture of a car insurance web app using an MVC framework. It includes a working database and has a hidden Admin page for the administrators to view all information in the database. This app will calcualte a car insurance quote from the information the user inputs. This is a work in prograss so only the functinality is ready, the web app interface will be designed soon to give it a cleaner more offical look. 
 
 
 
 
### CodeFirst

 This small console app was made using a the code-first method to create a database. This will simply ask the user to input information about a student and create and update a database based on the input recived. The program should then print all information about the students to the console. 
 
 
 ### TwentyOne 
 
 This console app is the fully functional game of black jack . The game will keep track of your wins and losses and has exceptions to common problems. If the user input someing wrong, the app will notify the user of error it encountered, and store the time and detailes of an error to a database so developers can check for bugs in the future.
